# Form Validation SBA
Created a small single-page web application that includes a form with the **Document Object Model** (DOM) in mind. It dissapears when the submit button is clicked on and a memory match card game appears.

## Reflection
### What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
- Write out the steps that a user would take to go from beginning to end of website and observe what they do.
- Create a better game plan and draw out everything that came to mind like tips and features and gameplay ideas.
- I would like to say that I wish I had more confidence in starting the project. I was slow to begin because I didn't break things down to small bites until later in development.

### Were there any requirements that were dificult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
- DOM event listeners seemed hard at first until I realized to include quotes when adding styles.
- Ran in to an issue with DOM elements styling getting applied to divs I had no intentions on adding to. Browser inspector helped with that fix.
### What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?
- Animations for sure!
- Designs on card backs and front.
- Add a timer and leaderboard would make it have much better replayability.
### Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process, or that may aid you when attempting something similar again:
- Just get started. Do not overthink it.
- Baby steps. Break down large problems in to bite sized problems and watch it all come together.
